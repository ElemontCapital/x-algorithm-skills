# 𝕩 Algorithm Skills

A suite of high-performance agent skills derived from a thorough analysis of the open-source **xAI X Algorithm**. These skills empower an agent to understand, optimize for, and build upon the X recommendation engine.

## 🚀 Installation

### Claude Code

Add the marketplace:

```bash
/plugin marketplace add ElemontCapital/x-algorithm-skills
```
Install the skills:
```bash
/plugin install x-algorithm
```
### Any Other Agent (Cursor, Windsurf, Roo Code, etc.)
You can use the universal installer to pull specific skills into your project context:
```bash
bunx add-skill ElemontCapital/x-algorithm-skills
```
To install a specific skill only (e.g., the optimizer):
```bash
bunx add-skill ElemontCapital/x-algorithm-skills x-post-optimizer
```
This performs a local copy of the skill files. You will need to re-run the command to receive updates. See [**AGENTS.md**](AGENTS.md) for detailed setup.

## ⚡ Skills

| Skill  | Best For | Description |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| **x-post-optimizer** | Content Creators | Optimize posts to hit high-weight signals like Author Replies and Dwell Time—get the algorithm to see you. |
| **x-architecture** | Architects | Map feed flows and candidate sources—design content that naturally aligns with the system. |
| **x-ranking-engine** | ML Engineers | Tune MaskNet and engagement heads—understand why content rises or disappears. |
| **x-dev-engineering** | Software Engineers | Build code that interacts with the ranking system—control cross-service logic behind posts. |
| **x-data-signals** | Data Scientists | Decode hidden account signals, map communities, and predict algorithm behavior. |
| **x-safety-filtering** | Policy & Safety | Audit VisibilityLib rules—stop silent suppression and keep content visible. |
| **x-retrieval-systems** | Search Engineers | Optimize sourcing, vector searches, and candidate diversity for maximum reach. |
| **x-experimental-ops** | Product Managers | Run A/B tests, track metrics, and manipulate flags—treat the feed like a lab. |
