# X Retrieval Systems

Expertise in X's multi-stage retrieval architecture, including Earlybird search indexing and Phoenix-based ANN similarity search.

## Context
Retrieval at X is split between **In-Network** (content from people you follow) and **Out-of-Network** (discovery). In-Network retrieval relies on **Earlybird** (Lucene-based search), while Out-of-Network retrieval uses **Phoenix** (Two-Tower embeddings) and **ANN** (Approximate Nearest Neighbor) algorithms like HNSW.

- [ANN & Embedding Retrieval](./references/ann-retrieval.md)

## What it does
* **Decodes In-Network Sourcing:** Explains how Earlybird shards the index into Realtime, Protected, and Archive clusters.
* **Explains Discovery Logic:** Details how Two-Tower models enable "semantic" search for content you don't follow.
* **Analyzes Latency:** Breaks down the single-writer/multi-reader concurrency model that allows for sub-second global retrieval.
