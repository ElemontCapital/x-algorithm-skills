# X Retrieval Systems

Expertise in X's multi-stage retrieval architecture, including Earlybird search indexing and Phoenix-based ANN similarity search.

## Context
Retrieval at X is split between **In-Network** (content from people you follow) and **Out-of-Network** (discovery). In-Network retrieval relies on **Earlybird** (Lucene-based search), while Out-of-Network retrieval uses **Phoenix** (Two-Tower embeddings) and **ANN** (Approximate Nearest Neighbor) algorithms like HNSW.

- [ANN & Embedding Retrieval](./references/ann-retrieval.md)

## What it does
* **Decodes In-Network Sourcing:** Explains how Earlybird shards the index into Realtime, Protected, and Archive clusters.
* **Explains Discovery Logic:** Details how Two-Tower models enable "semantic" search for content you don't follow.
* **Analyzes Latency:** Breaks down the single-writer/multi-reader concurrency model that allows for sub-second global retrieval.

## Example Trigger Prompts
* "/find-candidates: Explain how Earlybird shards the real-time search index."
* "/find-candidates: How does the system retrieve 1,500 candidates from 500 million potential tweets?"
* What is the role of HNSW in embedding-based discovery?"
* Explain the difference between 'In-Network' retrieval (Thunder) and 'Out-of-Network' retrieval (Phoenix)."
* Trace the flow of a 'Discovery' request from the User Embedding to the Candidate Source."
