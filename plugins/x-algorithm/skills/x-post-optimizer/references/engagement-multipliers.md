# Reference: Engagement Multipliers

Reach is calculated as a weighted sum of probabilities. To go viral, you must trigger the actions with the highest multipliers.



### High-Value Boosts
* **Author Reply (75x):** When the creator replies to a comment on their own post.
* **Retweet (20x):** Directly amplifies the post to the retweeter's network.
* **Like (30x):** Recently buffed to be more valuable than simple replies.
* **Dwell Time (>2 mins):** Stays on the "Post Detail" view. This signals high-quality content.

### Neutral/Low-Value Signals
* **Reply (1x):** A standard reply from a non-author has surprisingly low weight compared to a Like or RT.
* **Profile Click (0.1x):** Valuable for account growth but offers minimal immediate boost to the post's reach.

### Negative Multipliers (Reach Killers)
* **Report/Block (-50x):** Effectively kills the post's chance of appearing in Out-of-Network feeds.
* **"Show Less Often":** Triggers a 3-month "Fatigue" penalty for that user-author pair.
* **External Link:** Causes a static de-amplification (up to 80% reduction in candidates sourced).
