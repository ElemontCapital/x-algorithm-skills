# Reference: Account Reputation (TweepCred)

`TweepCred` is X's internal PageRank-style score for your account. It acts as a baseline "Quality Multiplier" for every post you make.

### Score Tiers (Approximate)
* **0–30 (Low/New):** Reach is heavily throttled. Posts mostly only show to a fraction of followers.
* **30–65 (Healthy):** Normal distribution. Eligible for "For You" discovery.
* **65–90+ (High Authority):** Massive reach multipliers. Content is pushed to "Out-of-Network" users very easily.

### How to Raise TweepCred
1.  **Verification:** Premium status provides an instant boost (~+100 to the raw base score).
2.  **Follower/Following Ratio:** Avoid being "follow-heavy." A higher ratio of followers to following improves trust.
3.  **Engagement Density:** It is better to have 10 tweets with 100 likes each than 100 tweets with 10 likes each.
4.  **Community Health:** Avoid being blocked or reported. Excessive negative feedback lowers your permanent reputation.

### The "Shadow" Hierarchy
* **Cold Start Suppression:** New accounts are restricted until they cross a certain interaction threshold.
* **Engagement Debt:** If your last 100 tweets had <0.5% engagement, the system applies a "Quality Decay" to your future posts.
