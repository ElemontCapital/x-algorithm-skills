# Reference: Content Formatting Guidelines

The algorithm's ingestion engine prefers specific formats that keep users within the X ecosystem.

### 1. The Video First Strategy
* **Native Uploads:** Never link a YouTube or TikTok video. Upload the file directly to X.
* **Vertical Format:** Mobile users dominate the platform; 9:16 or 4:5 ratios earn more screen real estate and dwell time.
* **Hook in 3 Seconds:** The "Dwell Time" counter starts immediately. Use captions and movement to prevent "Scroll-Past."

### 2. Thread Mechanics
* **Avoid "1/n" in the first tweet:** High-performance threads often use a standalone "Hook" tweet that leads into the rest of the content.
* **The "Second Tweet" Link:** If you must share a link, put it in the first reply (the second tweet of the thread) once the main tweet has gained traction.

### 3. Hashtag Minimalism
* **Quantity:** Use **zero to one** hashtag. 
* **Penalty:** Using 3+ hashtags is often flagged as "Search Spam" and can reduce your visibility in the "Explore" tab.

### 4. Text Length
* **Long-form Content:** Since the Grok-era update, high-quality long-form posts (available to Premium users) receive a boost in dwell time weighting, as they take longer to read.
