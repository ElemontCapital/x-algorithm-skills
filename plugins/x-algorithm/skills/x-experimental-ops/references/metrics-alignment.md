# Reference: Metrics & Alignment

X uses a hierarchy of metrics to determine if an algorithmic update is beneficial.

### The "North Star": Unregretted User Minutes
Unlike traditional platforms that optimize for pure "Time Spent," X aims for **Unregretted User Minutes**.
- **Definition:** Time spent that the user does not "regret" (e.g., time that doesn't lead to a "Show less often" click or an immediate app-close after seeing toxic content).
- **Measurement:** Often calculated by subtracting "Negative Signals" from total session time.

### Secondary Metrics
- **Daily Active Users (DAU):** Long-term retention.
- **Engagement Density:** The number of high-value actions (Likes/Replies) per 1,000 impressions.
- **Revenue per User:** Ensuring that ad-mixing doesn't drive users away while maintaining business viability.
